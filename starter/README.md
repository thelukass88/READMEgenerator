# Password Generator
![Github licence](https://img.shields.io/badge/your_licence:-MIT-blue.svg)
## Description
Using what I have learned recently in Javascript, I have used a series of variables and functions to generate a random password. The password characters will be selected by the user, based on a series of prompts, and will draw from one or more of a series of arrays which contain the chosen characters.
